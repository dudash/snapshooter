=============================================================

Snapshooter is a simple little utility that takes snapshots
of your desktop at specified intervals.  It loads into the
system tray so that it doesn't get in the way of things.
The prefix and postfix settings are for how the snapshot
file gets named.  I usually use them to indicate what I'm
working on.  It also has a screen saver mode that loads a
random image from your snapshot directory every minute until
you move or click the mouse.

Please let me know about any bugs.
