# snapshooter
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/snapshooter

Not sure this code is still relevant, but google has notified me that they are shutting down code.google.com, so I've exported this old project.

## About Snapshooter
The original 2007 description:
"Snapshooter is a simple little utility that takes snapshots
of your desktop at specified intervals.  It loads into the
system tray so that it doesn't get in the way of things.
The prefix and postfix settings are for how the snapshot
file gets named.  I usually use them to indicate what I'm
working on.  It also has a screen saver mode that loads a
random image from your snapshot directory every minute until
you move or click the mouse."

## From Google
Earlier today, Google announced we will be turning down Google Code Project Hosting. The service started in 2006 with the goal of providing a scalable and reliable way of hosting open source projects. Since that time, millions of people have contributed to open source projects hosted on the site.

But a lot has changed since 2006. In the past nine years, many other options for hosting open source projects have popped up, along with vibrant communities of developers. It’s time to recognize that Google Code’s mission to provide open source projects a home has been accomplished by others, such as GitHub and Bitbucket.

We will be shutting down Google Code over the coming months. Starting today, the site will no longer accept new projects, but will remain functionally unchanged until August 2015. After that, project data will be read-only. Early next year, the site will shut down, but project data will be available for download in an archive format.
