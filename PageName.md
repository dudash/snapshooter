# Introduction #

Snapshooter is a simple little utility that takes snapshots of your desktop at specified intervals. It loads into the system tray so that it doesn't get in the way of things. The prefix and postfix settings are for how the snapshot file gets named. It also has a screen saver ("boss") mode that loads a random image from your snapshot directory every minute until you move or click the mouse.

It was written with .NET and C#, and released under the GNU GPL 2.0
